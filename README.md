# StegoShield-Secure-Image-Steganography
A Python-based steganography tool that enables secure data hiding within images using AES encryption and OpenCV. This project combines cryptographic security with steganographic techniques to ensure confidential data remains hidden and undetectable. Provides a covert method for secure digital communication.
